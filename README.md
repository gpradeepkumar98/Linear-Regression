Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates the use of linear regression to predict car prices based on various features.
By building a linear regression model, we aim to create a tool that can estimate the price of a car given its attributes drivewheel,carlength,carwidth,carheight,curbweight,horsepower.


Introduction

Car pricing can be influenced by a wide range of factors, and predicting the accurate price of a car can be valuable for both buyers and sellers. 
In this project, we utilize linear regression, a simple yet effective machine learning technique, to create a predictive model that estimates car prices based on input features.
Data


    Run the car_price_prediction.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to see the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction steps.

Results

After training the linear regression model, we evaluate its performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared.
